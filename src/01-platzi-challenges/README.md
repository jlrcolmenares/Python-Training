# PlatziCoding
Most of the courses in Platzi gave you at least one coding challenge to do it by your own, as a matter of practice and a matter of expand your understanding of a given subject. 

The idea behind this repo is to share a wrap-up of interesting exercises or challenges that I solve while learning in Platzi. I plan to comment what I'm doing and the course where I learned this
